# Sample Hardhat Project

JennyCOin deployed at: 0xBEe6FFc1E8627F51CcDF0b4399a1e1abc5165f15

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
